Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as an easy-to-read markup language. Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. 
## The most common markdown elements
* h1 Heading: #
* h2 Heading: ##
* p: just type the words
* ul: * list item
* ol: 1. list item
* blockquote: >
> start a paragraph with the angle bracket
* a href: [text to display](http://example.com)
* img: ![alt text](path/to/image.png)
* table
